# ResoLib
Resource Library System for University.


# Introduction

When was the last time you were trapped trying to find resources when you needed them and couldn't find the right platform, or you had a resource file that only you could share with others?
We've all been in similar circumstances. If only there was a website where we could find a wealth of information. We had the same thought and decided to put it into action on our university campus. We titled our application "ResoLib" since we developed a Web application where students from the same university may come and view the resource file as well as share it with others.
This application aims to provide a platform for college students to locate resources provided by instructors and students.
